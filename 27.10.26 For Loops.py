#A teacher asks you to create a program that helps students practice multiplication. 
# The program should display the multiplication tables for numbers 1 through 5. 
# Each table should list the products of the number with every number from 1 to 5. 
# After completing the table for one number, the program should clearly separate it from the next numberâ€™s table.
#Write a Python program using nested for loops to achieve this. Expected output
